3Coffee
=======

A simple Java-based 2D game engine that was written during boring lectures.

Who is it for?
3Coffee is easy enough for newbies to start with, and loaded enough to support a small classic.

Disclaimer:
3Coffee is not a professional game engine, and neither is it optimized.
And though it is very possible to create production-quality games, a more skilled developer would
probably be better off with a nicer engine.

How to use:
1. Clone the project/download the zip, and import it in eclipse.
3. Clone the project/download the zip, and import as an eclipse project in Netbeans/IntelliJ-Idea.
